## About This Repo

My name is Parjanay and this is my first practice repo for learning Git.

I'm learning how to commit, push, and version control my code

## Git Learnings

- Learned how Git tracks staged and unstaged changes
- Understood why staging is explicit
- Made first commit and pushed to GitHub
- Learned Branching
